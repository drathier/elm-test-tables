# elm-test-tables
Elm-test-tables is a collection of elm-test helpers that I use to make it easier to write better tests.

The examples in this package are intentionally as simple as possible, and many of them look like you'd never have real-world use of them as a result. Don't worry, I've had real use-cases for all of these; they're just too large to fit in the docs.

Have a look around, let me know what you find useful, and if there's anything you're missing.
